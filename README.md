# OpenLibrary Hub

A modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) for discovering, organizing, and tracking books using the Open Library API.

OpenLibrary Hub enables readers to search millions of books, manage personalized reading lists, save favorites, rate books, and maintain reading notes—all within a streamlined and intuitive user experience.

---

## Overview

OpenLibrary Hub was developed as a Software Engineering Capstone Project with a focus on:

* Frontend performance optimization
* Modern React architecture
* Responsive user experience
* State management best practices
* API integration and asynchronous programming

The application integrates with the Open Library REST API to provide access to one of the world's largest collections of bibliographic records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm (included with Node.js)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephndemo/capstone_library.git

cd capstone_library/my-library-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in Browser

Visit:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Core Engineering Concepts

### Search Debouncing

To reduce unnecessary API calls, search requests are delayed until the user stops typing.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setDebouncedTerm(searchTerm);
    setPage(1);
  }, 600);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [searchTerm]);
```

### Local Storage Persistence

Application state is automatically synchronized with browser storage.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem(
    "bookshelf",
    JSON.stringify(bookshelf)
  );
}, [bookshelf]);
```

### Tailwind CSS v4 + Vite Integration

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
});
```

* RESTful API services

### Phase 3

* JWT authentication
* User accounts and profiles
* Cloud deployment

### Future Enhancements

* Reading analytics dashboard
* Monthly reading statistics
* Personalized recommendations
* Community discussions
* Social sharing features

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
